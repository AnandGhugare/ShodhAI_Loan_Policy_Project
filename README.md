# Policy Optimization for Financial Decision Making – LendingClub Project

## 📌 Overview

This project applies Machine Learning and Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) to improve the loan approval strategy for a fintech company using LendingClub accepted loan data (2007–2018).

We build and compare two approaches:

1. **Supervised Deep Learning Model** (PyTorch MLP predicting default probability)
2. **Offline RL-Style Policy** (profit-based policy + fallback behavior cloning)

Goal: **maximize expected financial return** while reducing loan default risk.
